# **Big-Basket-Cart-Prediction**

## **About**
This dataset contains lists of items purchased from Big Basket, an online grocery store. The Apriori algorithm, an Association Rule-based learning method, is used to predict which items are frequently bought together.

## **Dataset: Association Rule Learning on Big Basket Shopping List**
This dataset consists of a collection of shopping lists from Big Basket. Each row in the dataset represents a single shopping list consisting of various items bought together. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to remove any duplicates or missing values.

## **Data Description**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Transaction ID**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Items**: A comma-separated list of items bought together in a single transaction.

## **Apriori Algorithm**
The Apriori algorithm is an association rule-based learning algorithm used to identify frequent itemsets in a transactional dataset. It works by scanning the dataset multiple times to identify the most common itemsets that occur together.

Using Apriori, we can generate rules of the form:
> **If itemset A, then itemset B**

These rules are based on the frequency of co-occurrence of itemsets A and B in the dataset. They help in identifying patterns and making predictions about which items are likely to be bought together in future transactions.

## **Usage**
This dataset can be used for:
- **Association Rule Learning** to analyze shopping patterns.
- **Developing Predictive Models** to recommend items to customers based on their shopping history.

The dataset can be loaded into any programming language or data analysis tool that supports the CSV file format. To get started, you can apply the Apriori algorithm to:
1. Identify frequent itemsets in the dataset.
2. Generate association rules based on these itemsets.
3. Predict which items are likely to be bought together.

This analysis can help businesses optimize their product placement, marketing strategies, and personalized recommendations for customers.
